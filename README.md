# Algorithms In Java

Algorithm Implementations in Java. Algorithm functions are demonstrated in unit tests.

## Implemented algorithms

- **MatchRegEx**: Limited matching of regular expressions with support for ASCII chars, the dot operator, and the star operator.
- **FindCommonFactors**: Find greatest common factors for any two positive ints
- **Clutering**: K-map clustering
- **PalindromePartitioning**: Find all possible partitionings of a string where all partitions are palindromes
